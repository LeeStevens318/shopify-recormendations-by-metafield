# Shopify: Recormendations by metafield
## Admin
 * Add metafield in Admin under Product Category `Product Recommendation Tag` it will generate the namespace and key as `my_fields.product_recommendation_tag`. 
   Click "select content type", select Text and leave as default. Save.

## Theme
 * Copy Liquid Template `product-recommendations-metafield.liquid` in `Sections`
 * Copy Liquid Template `product-card-cart.liquid` in `Snippets`
 * Add `{% section 'product-recommendations-metafield' %}` to `product.liquid` in `Templates` (see example file)

## Products
For example, we will use a main product and available accessories for that product:

 * Go into each main product and set the metafield value
 * Now add that value to each accessory product this will make it show on the main product
